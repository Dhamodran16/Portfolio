              <strong>I'm Dhamodraprasath C M</strong><br /><br />
              Iâ€™m a passionate Full-Stack Developer and AI enthusiast from Salem, India, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence at Kongu Engineering College. My primary focus is on building modern, scalable web applications using React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB Atlas.
              
              I enjoy designing clean, responsive UIs and developing intuitive user experiences that run smoothly across platforms. I'm also experienced in integrating APIs, deploying web services, and building end-to-end solutions with cloud-based databases.
              
              As part of my internship at ShineLogics, I contributed to a web-based AI project focused on intelligent data automation and user interaction systems. This experience deepened my skills in real-time processing, UI/UX optimization, and collaboration within a professional development environment.
             
              Outside of development, I love exploring new tools in AI, experimenting with productivity-based projects, and staying on top of emerging trends in the tech ecosystem.
